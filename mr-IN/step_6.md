## Upgrade your project

If you have time you can upgrade your project.

Here are some ideas you could try:
- Use pins to display data — change the size or shape of the pin based on some value in the region's data. You can combine changes in shape and size to show even more.
- Filter the data — use `if` statements to only show pins on the map that meet conditions you choose. For example, only showing places where less than half the people live in cities. For an extra upgrade, let the user choose which filters to use.
- Add a second data file — create another file of data and display it using different pins. Can you use some of your existing functions if you make some small changes? Do you want to use two sets of pins, or put all the data together on one pin?

### Multicoloured pins: Population density

This project uses small multicoloured square pins and uses the population data set.

### Data-sized pins: Olympic host countries

This project has been upgraded to show larger pins for areas that have hosted the Olympic Games more often.

### Filter data: Global population — rural and urban

This project has been upgraded to allow you to choose the data used to make the display.
