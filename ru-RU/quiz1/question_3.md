Alex works for an organisation with offices all over the world. They often have to make displays like the one you created to share important data with their team. Why would it be a good idea for Alex to use code to do this work?

--- choices ---

- ( ) It will look better


  --- feedback --- Maybe, but beautiful displays can still be created on paper, or in graphics software. --- /feedback ---

- ( ) There will be no mistakes

  --- feedback --- It's true computer programs do exactly what they're told. But the programmer can still make mistakes when giving the program its instructions. That's where bugs come from! --- /feedback ---

- (x) Changing and updating data will be much faster

  --- feedback --- Correct. Because the code can be made up of functions with parameters, Alex only has to change what they pass in as their parameters to change the output. --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Coding is the future

  --- feedback --- That might be true, but that doesn't automatically make it better! --- /feedback ---
