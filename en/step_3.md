## Pick a map and pins

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
Choose how you'll display the data you've selected.

Set the size of your canvas to 991 pixels wide and 768 pixels high.

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - setup()
---  
  size(991, 768)

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

Think about how you want to display the data you've picked: What kind of map do you want to use? What shape of pin will you place in each location?

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Choose:** The started project includes several map images. Pick one you like, and load it to a `global` `map` variable in your `setup` function.

<mark>When we have all the images from design (and), add a gallery here, with the file names underneath each image. Currently, there are my two: mercator.jpeg and mercator_bw.png</mark>

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - setup()
---
def setup():
# Put code to run once here
    global map
    size(991, 768)    
    map = load_image('map.jpeg') # Replace with your image

--- /code ---

Add code to your `draw()` function to draw the map so it covers the whole canvas.

[[[p5-coordinates]]]

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - draw()
---
def draw():
# Put code to run every frame here
  image(
      map, # The image to draw
      0, # The x of the top-left corner
      0, # The y of the top-left corner
      width, # The width of the image
      height # The height of the image
      )
--- /code ---

--- /task ---

**Test:** Run your program and look at your map! You will probably need to switch to the fullscreen view to see the whole map.

--- /task ---

Now that you have a map, design some pins to show people using your display where they can click to see interesting facts about a place. Each pin will be a different colour. You will use the colour to tell which pin the user has clicked on. The pin can be any shape you want. Don't make it too big though, in some parts of the world countries are very close together!

--- task ---

Define a function called `draw_pin`. It should draw a pin, of your design, on the map. It should take three parameters:

 - The x coordinate for the pin
 - The y coordinate for the pin
 - The colour of the pin. This should be a `p5` `colour()`.

The `p5` `color()` function expects three numbers: one each for red, green, and blue.

```python
sky = color(92, 204, 206) #Red = 92, Green = 204, Blue = 206
```

You can use a colour to fill a shape with the `fill()` function. `fill()` changes every shape drawn after it.

```python
grass = color(149, 212, 122)
fill(grass)
rect(0, 250, 400, 150) # This shape will be filled with the colour
```

To remove fills completely, call `no_fill()` before drawing your shape(s).

You can set a colour for the border around a shape with the `stroke()` function:

```python
white = color(255, 255, 255)
stroke(white)
rect(0, 250, 400, 150) # This shape will have a white border
```

**Tip:** Your `draw_pin` function can make other shapes out of these basic ones.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Test your map by calling `draw_pin()` from `draw()`. Put the pin anywhere on the map, for now. You're just checking how it looks. Remove the pin when you're happy that the code works.

 **Debug:** You might find some bugs in your project that you need to fix. Here are some common bugs.

title: My map isn't loading

Check the filename really carefully â€” remember capital letters are different to lower case letters and punctuation is important.

title: My map is the wrong size

Check the inputs that control the width and height of the image:

```python
  image(
      map, # The image to draw
      0, # The x of the top-left corner
      0, # The y of the top-left corner
      width, # The width of the image
      height # The height of the image
      )
```

Make sure that you have called the `draw_pin()` function in your `draw()` function, and passed it the values it needs. For example:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - draw()
---
  draw_pin(width/2, height/2, color(255,0,0))
--- /code ---

Also, make sure you are calling `draw_pin()` after you call `image()` to create the background. If not, you're drawing the map over the pin!
