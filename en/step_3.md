Add code to your `setup()` function to set the size of your canvas to **991** pixels wide and **768** pixels high.

Think about how you want to display the data you've picked: what kind of map do you want to use?

Add code to your `setup()` function to draw the map so it covers the whole canvas.

**Choose:** What shape of pin will you place in each location? Your pin will need to be a single colour so that it is easy for a user to click on.

You could choose a single shape, such as:
+ A circle
+ A square
+ A triangle

Or you could create a pin out of multiple geometric shapes, such as:
+ A heart
+ A map pin
+ A star

Define a function called `draw_pin`. It should draw a pin, of your own design, on the map. It should take three parameters:

 - The x coordinate for the pin.
 - The y coordinate for the pin.
 - The colour of the pin. This should be a `p5` `Color()`.

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - draw_pin()
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 
line_highlights: 
---
def draw_pin(x, y, colour):
    # Put code to draw your pin here
--- /code ---

As you create your `draw_pin` function, call it to see how it appears on the screen. You should call your `draw_pin` function from the `setup()` function. 

You can use the arguments shown below to place a `red` pin the middle of the screen.

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - setup()
line_numbers: false
line_number_start: 
line_highlights: 12
---
def setup():
    # Put code to run once here
    size(991, 768)
    image(
        map,  # The image to draw
        0,  # The x of the top-left corner
        0,  # The y of the top-left corner
        width,  # The width of the image
        height  # The height of the image
    )
    draw_pin(300, 300, Color(255,0,0))

The `p5` `Color()` function expects three numbers: one each for red, green, and blue.

```python
blue = Color(92, 204, 206) #Red = 92, Green = 204, Blue = 206
```

You can use the `fill()` function to fill a shape with colour. `fill()` applies to every shape drawn after it.

```python
green = Color(149, 212, 122)
fill(green)
rect(0, 250, 400, 150)  # This shape will be filled with the colour
```

To remove fills completely, call `no_fill()` before drawing your shape(s).

You can set a colour for the border around a shape with the `stroke()` function:

```python
white = Color(255, 255, 255)
stroke(white)
rect(0, 250, 400, 150)  # This shape will have a white border
```

**Tip:** Your `draw_pin` function can make other shapes out of these basic ones.

**Debug:** You might find some bugs in your project that you need to fix. Here are some common bugs.

Check the filename really carefully â€” remember capital letters are different to lower-case letters and punctuation is important.

Check the inputs that control the width and height of the image:

```python
    image(
        map,  # The image to draw
        0,  # The x of the top-left corner
        0,  # The y of the top-left corner
        width,  # The width of the image
        height  # The height of the image
    )
```

Make sure that you have called the `draw_pin()` function in your `draw()` function, and passed it the values it needs. For example:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - draw()
---
    draw_pin(width/2, height/2, Color(255,0,0))
--- /code ---

Also, make sure you are calling `draw_pin()` after you call `image()` to create the background. If not, you're drawing the map over the pin!
